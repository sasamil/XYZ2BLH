1) Borkowsky is the slowest.

2) Moritz-Heiskennen is much faster then Borkowsky but it is still slow (comparing with other methods, here). Although it is
being used in 'proj' (most important library for geodetic transformations), it is clearly defeated by other algorithms.

3) Bowring-proj needs small modifications in order to be correct. Anyway, bowring-proj is not reliable at satellite 
altitudes. It's fast but it's not always accurate at cm/mm level. (keep in mind, it is practically heuristic)

4) Bowring-proj is faster that bowring23. Quite logical. 

5) IERS recommends Borkowsky. However, it is not fast i.e. it is the slowest. Worst of all - the code contains a bug.

6) Bowring23 and nr2 are equally accurate but a little slower at sattelite heights. (usually, one iteration more)

7) Direct solution and optimized-direct are equally good at sattelite heights. The same accuracy, the same performancies. They 
behave equally at any circumstances. (quit logical for direct solutions)

8) sq2 is equally accurate/fast at sattelite heights.

9) As for the speed - sq2 wins bowring-proj at usual heights but bowring-proj wins sq2 at satellite heights.

10) direct (and opt-direct) is an extremely fast quartic solver. Surprisingly, it beats even Moritz-Heiskennen, the most 
used BLH->BLh algorithm in geodetic praxis.

11) The similar ideas about reaching the high performancies can be found in Fukushima's work, however there are more 
transcedental functions (square roots) than in nr2. It's not tested yet but imo, it is not likely that it will be faster then 
nr2. (as I said - more square roots)

12) Performance: nr2 wins other methods at usual altitudes. The order is: (nr2, sq2), (bowring-proj, bowring23), (opt-direc),
direct, Moritz-Heiskennen), Borkowsky.

13) Performance: nr2 wins other methods at satellite altitudes. The order is: (nr2, bowring-proj, sq2), bowring23, (opt-direct,
direct, Moritz-Heiskennen), Borkowsky.
